This directory contains developer information about the internals of the tool,
use case, design and requirements.

It is not meant as a general guide for a user of how to use the tool. It is
meant for a developer that wants to change the tool. The documentation herein
try to explain why features exist, why they behave as they do, what the user
wanted to achieve. All this in such a way that future changes of the tool can
be made based on sane understanding of what the expectations are and not break
existing uses.
